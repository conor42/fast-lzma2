# Repository Guidelines

- Run `make test` before committing any changes. The command should finish with no errors.
- Use 4 spaces for indentation in all code files (C and Pascal).
- Delphi source code is stored in the `delphi` directory.
- Keep commit messages concise: a short summary line followed by an optional paragraph.
