# Delphi Port (Experimental)

This directory contains an experimental partial translation of Fast LZMA2's
lzma2-delphi-j9h89v
range encoder and decoder to the Delphi language.  It demonstrates how the
original C implementation can be mapped to Pascal types and functions.  The
port is **not** yet a complete reimplementation of the entire library; only a
subset of the range coder and decoder logic has been rewritten.  Further work
is required to port all compression and decompression features.
