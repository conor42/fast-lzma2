# Delphi Port (Experimental)

This directory contains an experimental partial translation of Fast LZMA2's
range encoder to the Delphi language.  It demonstrates how the original C
implementation can be mapped to Pascal types and functions.  The port is not a
complete reimplementation of the entire library; only a subset of the range
encoder logic has been rewritten.  Further work would be required to port all
compression and decompression features.
